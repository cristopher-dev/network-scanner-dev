This is an Electron application for network scanning with React frontend and TypeScript.

Use TypeScript for all new code with strict type checking enabled.

Use React 19 with functional components and hooks.

Use Material-UI (MUI) components for consistent UI design.

Use electron-store for persistent configuration storage.

Use node-nmap for network scanning functionality.

Use electron-log for logging throughout the application.

Follow the existing project structure: main process code in src/main, renderer process in src/renderer, shared utilities in src/shared.

Use proper IPC communication patterns between main and renderer processes.

Implement error handling with try-catch blocks and proper error logging.

Use interfaces and types for all data structures, especially for scan results and device information.

Follow Material-UI theming and styling patterns.

Use webpack configuration files in the configs directory for build processes.

Implement proper security practices for Electron applications.

Use async/await for asynchronous operations.

Maintain separation of concerns between UI components, business logic, and data access layers.
